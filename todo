✅ CurioCode — TODO Roadmap
🧩 Phase 1 — Project Setup (MVP Foundation)

Goal: Get a minimal but working full-stack app.

🔧 Backend (FastAPI)
~~ Initialize FastAPI project structure (screaming architecture). 
~~ Setup database (PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy / SQLModel).
 Implement JWT authentication (login/register endpoints).
 Create User and Curiosity models.
 Add role-based access control (user / admin).

 Create endpoints:
 POST /curiosities → create curiosity (pending approval)
 GET /curiosities → list approved curiosities
 POST /vote/{id} → vote for curiosity
 GET /admin/pending → list pending curiosities
 PATCH /admin/approve/{id} → approve curiosity

 Add unit tests (Pytest).



💻 Frontend (React + TypeScript)
 Setup project with Vite or CRA + TypeScript.
 ~~Setup folder structure (screaming architecture).~~
~~~~ Configure React Router.~
~~~~    setup tailwind css  ~~

 setup fonts colors and globals components like buttons or h1 and 

 Implement Context API or Redux for auth state.

 Build pages:
 Home Page: list curiosities + voting buttons.
 Login / Register: forms with React Hook Form.
 Create Curiosity: form to submit new curiosity.
 Profile Page (MVP): show only user’s name.
 Admin Dashboard: approve/reject curiosities.
 Connect to backend API (fetch curiosities, auth, create, approve).

 Add basic styling (Tailwind CSS).




🧠 Phase 2 — Enhancements & UX
Goal: Make the app feel polished and more engaging.
 Add toast notifications (success/error feedback).
 Add loading states and error boundaries.
 Add pagination or infinite scroll for curiosities.
 Add voting counter (funniest, rarest).
 Show list of top curiosities on Home.
 Display “pending” status for submitted curiosities.

 Add role indicator (Admin/User) in the UI.




🧪 Phase 3 — Testing
Goal: Ensure reliability and maintainability.

Frontend
 Add Jest + React Testing Library.
 Write tests for:
 Home page rendering curiosities.
 Form validation (login/register/create).
 Auth context / store.
 Voting interaction.

Backend
 Add Pytest for:
 Auth routes.
 CRUD curiosities.
 Admin approval.
 Use test DB (SQLite in-memory).




☁️ Phase 4 — Deployment & DevOps
Goal: Make the app production-ready.
 Create Docker setup for frontend + backend + database.
 Add .env configuration.
 Setup GitHub Actions for CI/CD (run tests on push).
 Deploy backend (Render, Railway, or AWS Lambda).
 Deploy frontend (Vercel or Netlify).
 Connect domain + HTTPS.




🚀 Future Features (Post-MVP)
Goal: Grow beyond a simple MVP.
 Add tags or categories for curiosities.
 Add user avatars and bios.
 Implement search and filters.
 Add comment section.
 Add leaderboard (top contributors).
 Send “daily curiosity” email/newsletter.
 Dark mode toggle 🌙.
